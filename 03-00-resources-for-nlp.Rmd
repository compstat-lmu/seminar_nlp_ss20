# Introduction: Resources for NLP

*Authors: Nico Hahn*

*Supervisor: Daniel Schalk*

As natural language processing has become one of the hottest topics in data science/statistics in recent years, tons of new resources have been created. As a result, NLP has become accessible to a wide range of people, making it easier to train and compare models. Competitions have emerged to determine who can develop the best model for specific tasks such as question answering.

In the following chapter, we will take a look at some of these benchmark datasets to see what tasks they are used for and how performance is assessed on these datasets.

In addition to that we will be talking about pre-training resources, what they are and why they are useful.

Lastly, we will be introducing the huggingface transformers module.
