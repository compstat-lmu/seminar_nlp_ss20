# Resources and Benchmarks for NLP

Frameworks such as TensorFlow or Keras allow users to train a wide range of different models for different tasks. Let us assume that two models for a simple question-answer system are trained, one with attention and one without attention. How can these models be evaluated in order to find the model better suited to the task? Quite simply, through benchmarking. This section looks at some of the most commonly used benchmarking datasets and at pre-training resources.

## Metrics
For many of the benchmarking datasets in natural language processing, a leaderboard exists in which different models are compared with each other. Depending on the task, the models are evaluated with different metrics. In this section we will introduce those used for the benchmarking datasets presented later.
  
**Exact match.** The percentage of predictions that match any one of the answers exactly.  
  
**(Macro-averaged) F1 score.** Each answer and prediction is tokenized into words. For every answer to a given question, the overlap between the prediction and each answer is calculated and the maximum F1 is chosen. This score is then averaged over all of the questions.



## Benchmark Datasets
### SQuAD
The first Version of the **S**tanford **Qu**estion **A**nswering **D**ataset was released in 2016. The dataset was created with the aim of advancing the field of reading comprehension. Reading text and answering questions about it is a demanding task for machines and requires large data sets of high quality. Most of the datasets before the release of the first version of SQuAD were either of high quality or of large size, but not both.  
  
With the help of crowdworkers, 107.785 question-answer pairs were created for 536 Wikipedia articles. For each question, the answer is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage. 
Pairs were collected in a two-step process. In the first step the crowdworkers were asked to generate five questions and their answers per paragraph.  
  
In the second step, each crowdworker was shown only the questions along with the paragraphs of the corresponding article and was asked to choose the shortest span in the paragraph that answered the question.  
  
The goal of this process was to get a more robust evaluation and to obtain an indicator of human performance on SQuAD.  
  
One shortcoming of reading comprehension systems is that they tend to make unreliable guesses on questions to which no correct answer is possible. With this in mind, the second version of SQuAD was released in 2018. In addition to the approximately 100.000 questions from the first version, 53.775 new, unanswerable questions on the same paragraphs are contained in this dataset.  
  

The accuracy of models trained on SQuAD is evaluated using two different metrics, exact match and (Macro-averaged) F1 score, both ignoring punctuation and articles.  
  
To evaluate human performance, the second answer to each question is treated as the human prediction.[@rajpurkar2016squad; @rajpurkar2018know]  
  
Humans achieve an **EM** score of 86.831 and a **F1** score of 89.452.  
  
Currently, the best performing model achieves an **EM** score of 90.386 and a **F1** score of 92.777.

### CoQA
CoQA is a dataset for building **Co**nversational **Q**uestion **A**nswering systems. Humans are capable of gathering information through conversations that include several interrelated questions and answers. The aim of CoQA is to enable machines to answers conversational questions.  
  
The data set is made up of 127k Q/A pairs, covering seven different domains such as Children's Stories or Reddit. Five of these domains are used for in-domain evaluation and two are used for out-of-domain evaluation. To create the Q/A pairs, two people received a text passage, with one person asking the other person questions about the text and the other person answering. Using multiple annotators has a few advantages:

1. A natural flow of conversation is created.
2. If one person gives an incorrect answer or a vague questions is asked, the other person can raise a flag. Thus bad annotators can easily be identified.
3. If there is a disagreement, the two annotators can discuss it via a chat window.

Similar to SQuAD, three additional answers are collected for each question. However, since the answers influence the flow of the conversation, the next question always depends on the answer to the previous question. For this reason, two different answers to the same question can lead to two different follow-up questions. In order to avoid incoherent discussions, annotators are shown a question that they must answer first. After answering, they are shown the original answer, and they must then confirm that their answer has an identical meaning.  

Compared to SQuAD 2.0, there is a greater variety of question types in CoQA. While almost half of the questions in the SQuAD start with *what*, less than a quarter of the questions in the CoQA begin with this token. Another major difference is that questions in CoQA are on average 5.5 words long, compared to an average length of 10.1 in SQuAD. It is also worth mentioning that about 10% of the answers in CoQA are either yes or no, whereas there are no such answers in SQuAD.   
  
Like SQuAD, trained models are evaluated using a macro-average F1 score. Models are evaluated separately on the in-domain dataset and the out-of-domain dataset. [@coqa2019]  
  
Humans achieve a **F1** score of 89.4 for in-domain and a **F1** score of 87.4 for out-of-domain.  
  
Currently, the best performing model achieves a **F1** score of 91.4 for in-domain and a **F1** score of 89.2 for out-of-domain.

### (Super)GLUE
Most models in NLP are designed to solve a specific task, such as answering questions from a particular domain. This limits the use of models for understanding natural language. In order to process language in a way that is not limited to a specific task, genre, or dataset, models should be able to solve a variety of tasks well.
  
The **G**eneral **L**anguage **U**nderstanding **E**valuation benchmark dataset is a collection of tools created with this in mind. It is designed to encourage and favour models that share common linguistic knowledge across tasks. These tasks include textual entailment, sentiment analysis and question answering. Some tasks come with a lot of training data, others with less. Common to all datasets is that they were not created specifically for GLUE, but are existing datasets. Models that are evaluated on GLUE only need to have the ability to process single-sentence and sentence-pair inputs and make appropriate predictions.
GLUE also includes a hand-crafted diagnostic test suite that enables detailed linguistic analysis of models.
The models are scored separately for each task and then a macro-average of these scores is calculated to determine a system's position on the ranking. If a task has multiple metrics, an unweighted average of these metrics is used as the score for the task when calculating the overall macro average. [@wang2018glue]
The human baseline score is 87.1, while the best model score is currently 90.6.
  
A good year after the release of GLUE, models surpassed human performance. In response to this, a new benchmark, SuperGLUE, was introduced. It follows the same principles as GLUE, however the tasks included are more challenging. The two hardest tasks in GLUE remain, the rest were selected based on difficulty for current NLP approaches. [@wang2019superglue]
For SuperGLUE, the human baseline score is 89.8, which is above the best model score, presently 89.3.
